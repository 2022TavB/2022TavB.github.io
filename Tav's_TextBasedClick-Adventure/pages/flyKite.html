<h1>The Strange Elf Adventure</h1>
<hr>
<h4>You decide to help your brother.</h4>
<div>You take the kite from your brother and start to run back with it. Just as you are about to turn to watch your step you trip over a root. As you fall you let go of the kite, watching it soar in the air. Your brother doesn't seem to notice. Your trip knocks you into a berry bush, you bonk your head on the branches and you're out.</div>
